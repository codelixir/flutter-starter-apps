# Flutter Starter Apps

A bunch of simple apps built using Flutter. Trying to build them could be a good exercise in getting familiar to the toolkit. I built them either by referencing [Google Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) or while attending Flutter developers workshops during [Google I/O 2021](https://events.google.com/io) (or, in some cases, both). Hence this code is not original, and matches a lot (maybe around 90%) with the tutorial code.

I have mentioned useful links and more details in the readme of each individual project.

Here are the projects included so far:

## Nomenclator

A good first project for Flutter development.

## Horizons

A good project to learn how we can improve the app UI/UX. Focuses mainly on Sliver widgets.

## MeetUp

A good project to understand how Firebase works and how we can use it in our Flutter project.
