# MeetUp

A Flutter project to understand the basics of Firebase by creating Flutter apps for Android and iOS that use Firebase Auth and Firestore. I made this during a [workshop](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-flutter#0?utm_source=google-io21&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=io21-resources)
as a part of [Google I/O 2021](https://events.google.com/io/).
