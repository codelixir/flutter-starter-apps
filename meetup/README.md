# MeetUp

A Flutter project to understand the basics of Firebase by creating Flutter apps for Android and iOS that use Firebase Auth and Firestore. I made this during a [workshop](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-flutter#0?utm_source=google-io21&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=io21-resources)
as a part of [Google I/O 2021](https://events.google.com/io/).

## About the App

Note that you need to install a config file from your Firebase project if you wish to try this out since I have not included that file in git. The file is supposed to be at the path
```
android/app/google-services.json
```
for android. For iOS you need to set-up the config file using XCode.
